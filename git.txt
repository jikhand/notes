PROBLEMS FACE

1)
Prob:
Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.

ans:
Try deleting index.lock file in your .git directory.
$rm -f .git/index.lock

2)
prob:
fatal: does not appear to be a git repository
ans:
To update the URL for origin you could do:
$git remote set-url origin git@skarp.beanstalkapp.com:/gittest.git
